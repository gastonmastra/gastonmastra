# Hello! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Gastón but you can call me Mastra, a recent graduate in Information Systems Engineering from the Universidad Tecnológica Nacional, Facultad Regional Córdoba.
I am passionate about technologie in general, and software is where I fell through the twists and turns of life.


## About Me
- 🎓 Graduated in Information Systems Engineering.
- 💼 FullStack Developer at [JazuSoft](https://jazusoft.com).
- 🌍 I'm from Villa Carlos Paz, Argentina.
- 📍 Currently located in Málaga, Spain
- 📅 Born on 03/22/2001.

## Technologies
I used to work a lot with Angular and .NET. Nowadays I'm working with Django and React.
I'm a person that can change technologies on the way (or at least so I try 😅) so I feel comfortable with many frameworks.

## Learning
Currently, I'm focused on learning:
- 🔒 Clean Architecture
- 🧪 Unit Testing (well, I should have made this before but here we are...)
- 🤖 IaC
